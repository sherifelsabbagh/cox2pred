st.header("What is LRRK2?")
st.write("* Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) is a large multidomain serine-threonine kinase of 2527 amino acids: armadillo repeat motif (ARM), an-kyrin repeat (ANK), leucine-rich repeat (LRR), ras-of-complex(ROC), C-terminal of ROC (COR), kinase (KIN), and WD40 domains ")
st.write("* It is involved in vesicular trafficking, autophagy, protein synthesis, and cytoskeletal function; it also interacts with mitochondrial proteins and may be involved in the immune system. ")
st.write("* LRRK2 is highly expressed in the striatum's medium-sized spiny neurons, as well as macrophages and microglia, indicating an involvement in inflammatory pathways.")
st.write("* LRRK2 is a key factor to comprehending Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis, according to a number of lines of evidence. The mechanism behind the biological functions of LRRK2 is still completely unknown, but it plays an important role in regulating cellular function and formation of pathogenic filaments")
st.write("*  Several mutations in LRRK2 have been linked to PD. The two most prevalent mutations are R1441C, which is located in the ROC-COR domain and G2019S, an autosomal dominant missense mutation in the kinase domain that decreases the processivity of autophagosome transport in neurons in a kinase-dependent manner")
st.write("* LRRK2 has been identified as a potential therapeutic target for both sporadic and familial PD")
